    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>
        The <b>chicken</b> (<i><b>Gallus gallus domesticus</b></i>) is a large and round short-winged
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird">bird</a>, domesticated from
        the red
        junglefowl
        of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are
        kept as pets or for cockfighting.

        Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an
        annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There
        are
        numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature.
