/* 
Some CSS property values set on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't

For example, if you set a color and font-family on an element, 
    every element inside it will also be styled with that color and font, 
    unless you've applied different color and font values directly to them

Some properties do not inherit â€” 
    for example, if you set a width of 50% on an element, 
    all of its descendants do not get a width of 50% of their parent's width

    Some elements do not inherit either
    For example, buttons do not inherit the color of their parent
